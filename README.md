# AoC2024

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª An attempt to learn [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) by working through the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.

üìÄ Using [uiua v0.14.0-dev.5 ](https://github.com/uiua-lang/uiua#90b11407)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è1 Historian Hysteria

The puzzle is pretty simple involving sorting lists of numbers. My rudimentary uiua is up to solving the problem with not much more than *sort*, *absolute value* and *reduce add*.  Most of my learning is how to handle the file input and turn it into the kind of arrays I want.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è2 Red-Nosed Reports

Getting the input is much simpler now! This involves checking if the numbers in rows of the input meet certain criteria. I used *sign*, *unique* and *match*, figured out how to run tests with *assert with match* and used *fork* to do different things with the same bits of data. I use *tuples* in part two to get combinations of the data with one element missing but don't really figure out what it's doing yet. And realise I can use *content* to unbox the arguments to a function before calling it.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 3 Mull It Over
We're looking through a stream of text looking for `mul(x,y)` commands. I use *regex* which feels a bit of a cheat as it's not really uiua at all. For the second part we need to ignore parts of the string and rather than doing more regex I use *partition* and *mask* to split the input and remove sections, in a very similar way to the way I usually handle the input. Finding the *shape* of arrays helped me debug.

## 4 ‚≠êÔ∏èCeres Search
This is a wordsearch grid that only contains X, M, A and S and you are looking for how many times the word XMAS appears in it. Getting the horizontal and vertical words using *find*, *reverse* and *transpose*. I spend approximately forever trying to get the diagonals of the grid out. I use *keep* *pick*. I run into trouble trying to make a function that works on one element work with *rows* and get the advice to use *rows F dip fix* which I don't understand at the time. Eventually I get an answer but it's too low and I give up for now. I think I need to use a different approach than finding the diagonals as I'm clearly doing something wrong.

üÜïI came back to look at this on the 7th and found I'd made an incorrect assumption which had resulted in me finding the same set of diagonals twice over; which worked on the test data but not on the real data.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è5 Print Queue
We're figuring out if lists of numbers meet certain ordering rules. The data is more complicated to parse today with two separate sections and I start to find juggling the items on the stack a bit complicated. I use *on* to keep things on top of the stack when I call a function. I put the rules into a *map*.  I use *memberof* to check if the numbers meet the rules. I work out looping with *do* and *switch*.

The *signature* function has been removed from uiua and replaced with the macro `(‚ãÖ‚ä¢)^!` which I'm putting (along with macros) on my list of things to look at later, but it's useful for debugging. I don't get around to trying out the second part of the puzzle.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è6 Guard Gallivant
There's a guard walking round a room turning right every time she meets an obstacle. We need to figure out how many squares she visits before she walks off the grid. I trace the guards path in the grid replacing spaces she visits with Xs and then count them up at the end.I use *under pick* to replace locations in the grid though needing to do an *unfix* between this and the result of *where find* confuses me. Wrangling the stack is still causing me grief though I eventually feel like I'm working out how *fork* and *planet notation* go together.  I find *below* useful for keeping all the inputs to a function below its result on the stack. I struggle with the bounds check for the guard leaving the grid. Negative indices refer to rows at the end of the grid, only oversize numbers throw an error. 

I'm really pleased with getting the solution to part one and should have stopped there as I spend a lot of time on the second part before realising I've slightly misunderstood the question.

##  ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è7 Bridge Repair

This is the first day where I feel like I'm writing code in uiua rather than wrangling with slippery eels. My algorithm is not very efficient and takes a while to run but it works and I feel the code is reasonably clean and I'd know what it was doing if I looked back at it. I'm a lot clearer about what's going onto the stack and how to rearrange it. I used *subscripts* for the first time which don't work on everything but they are very neat when they do. I'm quite happy with how easily I got part two extrapolated from my part one solution too.

## üìëbookmarked to look at further
- *tuples* how do the operators work?
- *rows F dip fix* (I've worked out why this works but not explained it here yet.)
- `(‚ãÖ‚ä¢)^!` signature macro.
- *unfix* needed between *where find* and *under pick*. why?
- Out of bounds checks, is there an easy way?
