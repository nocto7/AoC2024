# Part One

This is the first day where I've felt I could actually just write code rather than needing copious notes to keep track of what I was up to. Also documenting the code helped.

I made life hard for myself by misreading the puzzle and thinking I needed to work out whether any combination of the numbers would work rather than just using them in left to right order, but once my real input had failed on that because uiua wouldn't let me generate an array with a gazillion combos in it I went back and read the puzzle again and got the answer straight off.
